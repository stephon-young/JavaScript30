  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //let captain = 'yasir';
    //let cap2 = captain;
    //cap2 = 'arqam';
    //console.log(captain, cap2);

    //let age = 23;
    //let age2 = age;
    //console.log(age, age2);
    //age2 = 34;
    //console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //console.log(team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //team[2] = 'arqam';
    // now here is the problem!
    //console.log(players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    //console.log(players);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
   //const newArray = [].concat(players);
    //newArray[2] = 'arqam';
    //console.log(players);
    //console.log(newArray);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //const team = [...players];
    //team[2] = 'arqam';
    //console.log(players);
    //console.log(team);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        fb: 'asda',
        tw: 'asdasd',
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const p2 = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const p3 = {...person};
    const p4 = Object.assign({},person);

    p3.social.fb = 'Yasir Janjua';
    p4.name = 'Arqam';
    console.log(p3);
    console.log(p4);
    console.log(person);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const p5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
